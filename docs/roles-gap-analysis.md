## 1. Executive Summary

The Orion role system is **functionally correct for the three roles actively in use** (master, torredecontrol, ventas). The ventas role is well-isolated by middleware, the server-side OTP auth flow is secure, and the `app_metadata` approach for immutable roles is best-practice.

However, the system has **significant gaps when measured against enterprise SaaS standards:**

| Category | Gap Count | Severity | Resolved |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Security & Data Exposure | 5 | 2 Critical, 3 High | 5 resolved (GAP-01/02/03/04/05) |
| Role Architecture | 4 | 1 Critical, 3 High | 3 resolved (GAP-06/07/08) |
| Dashboard & Visualization | 6 | 2 High, 4 Medium | 2 resolved (GAP-10/11) |
| Authorization & Workflows | 5 | 1 High, 4 Medium | 2 resolved (GAP-16/18) |
| Compliance & Audit | 4 | 2 High, 2 Medium | 2 resolved (GAP-21/22) |

**Total: 24 identified gaps. 20 resolved as of 2026-03-20.** (Phase 2 resolved GAP-07/08/21 + DISC-03 on 2026-03-20. Phase 4 resolved GAP-03 on 2026-03-20.)

~~The single most impactful issue: **four defined roles (gerencia, financiero, contabilidad, inventario) are dead code.** A user assigned any of these roles would see the full admin NavBar, access the analytics dashboard, and receive 403 errors on admin operations — a confusing and potentially data-exposing experience.~~

**Update (2026-03-19):** The 3 critical gaps and 9 high-severity gaps have been resolved (changelogs 074 + 075, Phases 3 + 5). Security: middleware has explicit 5-category role routing, NavBar is role-filtered, 30+ API routes secured with role guards, OCR endpoints have auth + rate limiting, ownership-scoped RLS policies enforce ventas data isolation. Audit: centralized `audit_events` table with `logAudit()` utility, 10 admin routes instrumented, `/admin/audit` viewer page. Operations: `/admin/operaciones` dashboard with work queues and activity feed. The remaining 12 gaps are structural (permission architecture), field masking, workflow, and compliance items.

## 2. Critical Gaps (Security & Data Exposure)

### GAP-01: API Routes Accessible Beyond Intended Roles — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 074)
**Severity: Critical**

**Current state:** 20+ API routes use only `requireAuth()` — any authenticated user (including ventas) can call them directly. This includes:
- `GET /api/analytics/commissions` — all commission data
- `GET /api/analytics/payments` — all payment data
- `GET /api/analytics/cash-flow-forecast` — cash flow projections
- `GET /api/sales` — all sales data
- `GET /api/commission-rates` — commission rate configuration
- `GET /api/projects` — project CRUD (including POST/PATCH/DELETE)
- `GET /api/payments` — payment records
- All `/api/reservas/referidos`, `/api/reservas/valorizacion`, `/api/reservas/buyer-persona` routes

**Best practice:** API routes should enforce the same role restrictions as the pages that call them. Middleware blocks ventas users from seeing the commission dashboard page, but a ventas user who knows the API URL can fetch the same data directly via `fetch('/api/analytics/commissions')`.

**Impact:** A technically savvy salesperson (or a script) could access all commission data for all salespeople, all payment data, all sales data, and even create/modify projects. This is a data exposure risk.

**Recommendation:** Add `requireRole()` guards to all API routes that serve data intended only for admin roles. At minimum:
- Analytics routes → `requireRole(["master", "torredecontrol", "gerencia", "financiero"])`
- Commission/payment routes → `requireRole(["master", "torredecontrol", "financiero"])`
- Project CRUD → `requireRole(["master", "torredecontrol"])` for write operations
- Referidos/valorizacion management → `requireRole(["master", "torredecontrol"])`

### GAP-02: Public OCR Endpoints Without Rate Limiting — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 074)
**Severity: Critical**

**Current state:** `POST /api/reservas/dpi-ocr` and `POST /api/reservas/ocr` are fully public. Any unauthenticated caller can submit images for Claude Vision processing, consuming API credits.

**Best practice:** All endpoints that consume external API credits (Claude, OpenAI, etc.) must have authentication and rate limiting.

**Impact:** An attacker could exhaust Claude API credits by submitting bulk image processing requests. No rate limiting is visible in the codebase.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add `requireAuth()` at minimum (or `requireSalesperson()` for the intended use case)
2. Add per-user rate limiting (e.g., max 10 OCR requests per hour per user)

### GAP-03: No Server-Side Field Masking on Analytics Routes — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 079, 2026-03-20)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~The dual-auth routes for reservation detail correctly mask fields (omitting `audit_log`, `sale_rate`, `monthly_context` for salesperson callers). However, the analytics API routes (`/api/analytics/commissions`, `/api/analytics/payments`, etc.) return the full dataset regardless of the caller's role.

**Best practice:** Every API response should be filtered based on the caller's role. If a route is accessible to a Sales Manager, they should see team-level aggregates, not individual commission amounts for all salespeople across all projects.

**Impact:** If/when the gerencia or financiero roles are activated, users with these roles would receive the same data as master — including potentially sensitive data like individual commission amounts for all salespeople, individual payment compliance per unit, etc.

~~**Recommendation:** Implement role-aware response shaping — the same API endpoint returns different data granularity depending on the caller's role.~~

**Resolution (2026-03-20):** `src/lib/field-masking.ts` — 4 per-resource masking functions applied after Supabase queries, before `jsonOk()`. Defense-in-depth: unknown roles default to most restrictive masking (gerencia-level).

| Function | Route | gerencia | contabilidad |
|----------|-------|----------|--------------|
| `maskCommissionsAnalytics()` | `/api/analytics/commissions` | `byRecipient: []`, ISR/disbursable zeroed | `recipientName` → "Beneficiario N" |
| `maskPaymentCompliance()` | `/api/analytics/payment-compliance` | `paymentHistory: []` per unit | No masking |
| `maskPaymentsAnalytics()` | `/api/analytics/payments` | Money fields zeroed, `paymentHistory: []` | No masking |
| `maskCommissionsLegacy()` | `/api/commissions` | `data: []` (keep totals) | `recipient_name` → "Beneficiario N" |

**financiero, master, torredecontrol:** Full access — no masking. Cash flow route excluded (aggregate data, no PII). Dashboard: `role` prop passed to `DashboardClient`, Comisiones tab hidden for gerencia.

### GAP-04: Inactive Roles Have Uncontrolled Access — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 075)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~The four inactive roles (gerencia, financiero, contabilidad, inventario) are defined in the TypeScript type but have no middleware enforcement, no NavBar differentiation, and no API-level guards.~~ **Resolved.** Middleware now has explicit 5-category role routing: `ventas` → restricted, `ADMIN_PAGE_ROLES` (master, torredecontrol) → full admin access, `DATA_PAGE_ROLES` (gerencia, financiero, contabilidad) → analytics pages only (blocked from /admin, /referidos, /valorizacion, /cesion, /buyer-persona, /integracion), unknown/null roles → redirect to /login. NavBar links are tagged with `roles` arrays and filtered by the user's role at render time.

~~If a user were assigned `role = "financiero"`:~~
~~- Middleware: non-ventas → full page access~~
~~- NavBar: shows all admin links~~
~~- API: passes `requireAuth()` checks → access to analytics, commissions, payments~~
~~- API: fails `requireRole(["master", "torredecontrol"])` → blocked from reservation admin operations~~
~~- Net effect: full read access to sensitive financial data, no ability to take any admin action, confusing UX~~

**Best practice:** Every role in the system should have explicitly defined access boundaries. Undefined behavior is a security gap.

**Recommendation:** ~~Either:~~
~~- **Option A (recommended):** Implement full middleware and API enforcement for all four roles before assigning any user to them~~
~~- **Option B (temporary):** Remove the inactive roles from the type definition and re-add them when implementation is ready.~~
**Implemented Option A** — middleware, NavBar, and API routes all enforce explicit role boundaries.

### GAP-05: No Row-Level Ownership Enforcement at Database Level — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 075, migration 040)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~Ownership scoping for ventas users (see only own reservations, own clients) is implemented at the API layer via query filters (`WHERE salesperson_id = $1`). The RLS policies allow any authenticated user to SELECT all rows from `reservations`, `rv_clients`, `reservation_clients`, etc.~~ **Resolved.** Migration 040 deployed ownership-scoped RLS policies on 4 tables: `reservations`, `rv_clients`, `reservation_clients`, `receipt_extractions`. Uses a reusable `jwt_role()` helper function. Ventas users see only rows linked to their own `salespeople.user_id`. Non-ventas roles see all rows. INSERT policies on `reservations` and `reservation_clients` also tightened from `TO public` to `TO authenticated`.

**Best practice:** Row-level ownership should be enforced at the database level via RLS policies. If a new API route is added and forgets the ownership filter, the database should prevent data leakage.

~~**Impact:** Any new API endpoint that queries reservations or clients without adding the `salesperson_id` filter would expose other salespeople's data. The defense relies entirely on developer discipline at the API layer.~~

~~**Recommendation:** Add ownership-scoped RLS policies for ventas users.~~
**Implemented** — defense-in-depth now operates at both API layer (query filters) and database layer (RLS policies).

---

## 3. Structural Gaps (Role Architecture)

### GAP-06: No Role Hierarchy — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 074)
**Severity: Critical**

**Current state:** The system has three active roles treated as flat, independent categories:
- `master` → everything
- `torredecontrol` → almost everything (minus 2 master-only endpoints)
- `ventas` → restricted to own data

There is no inheritance. The system checks for exact role matches: `requireRole(["master", "torredecontrol"])`.

**Best practice (Salesforce model):** Hierarchical RBAC where senior roles automatically inherit all permissions of subordinate roles. Example:
```
master
  └─ torredecontrol
       └─ gerencia (future)
            └─ ventas
```
A `gerencia` user would automatically have all `ventas` permissions plus manager-level additions. A `torredecontrol` user would have all `gerencia` permissions plus operational controls.

**Impact:** Every time a new role needs to be activated, every `requireRole()` call in every API route must be manually updated to include the new role. This is error-prone and violates DRY.

**Recommendation:** Implement a role hierarchy utility:
```typescript
const ROLE_HIERARCHY: Record<Role, number> = {
  ventas: 10,
  inventario: 20,
  contabilidad: 30,
  financiero: 40,
  gerencia: 50,
  torredecontrol: 60,
  master: 100,
};

function hasMinimumRole(userRole: Role, requiredRole: Role): boolean {
  return ROLE_HIERARCHY[userRole] >= ROLE_HIERARCHY[requiredRole];
}
```
Then `requireRole("torredecontrol")` would automatically pass for `master`. Routes requiring `gerencia` would automatically pass for `torredecontrol` and `master`.

### GAP-07: No Permission Matrix / Formal Access Control Document — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 078, 2026-03-20)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~Permissions are implicitly defined by scattered `requireRole()` calls across 50+ API routes and middleware checks. There is no single document or data structure that maps (role, resource, action) → allowed/denied.~~ **Resolved.** `src/lib/permissions.ts` defines the `PERMISSIONS` matrix: `Record<Resource, Partial<Record<Action, Role[]>>>` covering 22 resources, 49 permission triples, 119 role grants. Every entry is a direct transcription of existing `requireRole()` calls. `docs/access-control-matrix.md` is auto-generated from this matrix via `scripts/generate-access-matrix.ts`.

**Best practice:** A formal access control matrix — either as a document or as a code-level data structure — that defines every permission triple (verb, noun, scope) and which roles have it. This is a SOC 2 requirement (CC6.1) and makes auditing tractable.

~~**Recommendation:** Create an access control matrix (code-level, not just documentation) that is the single source of truth for all authorization checks. All `requireRole()` calls should reference this matrix rather than hardcoding role lists.~~
**Implemented:** `PERMISSIONS` matrix as SSOT. 15 hardcoded-array routes migrated to `rolesFor()`. 3 duplicate constants eliminated.

### GAP-08: No `can(action, resource)` Utility — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 078, 2026-03-20)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~Authorization checks are scattered across components and routes as direct role string comparisons:~~
~~- `role === 'ventas'` in NavBar~~
~~- `requireRole(["master", "torredecontrol"])` in API routes~~
~~- `readOnly` prop hardcoded based on path~~
~~- `isSalespersonFailure()` in dual-auth routes~~

**Resolved.** `src/lib/permissions.ts` exports two functions:
- `can(role, resource, action)` → `boolean` — for UI conditional rendering and script consumption
- `rolesFor(resource, action)` → `Role[]` — for API routes as `requireRole(rolesFor("reservations", "confirm"))`

15 routes migrated from hardcoded arrays to semantic `rolesFor()` calls (18 total `requireRole()` replacements). Remaining 22 routes already using `ADMIN_ROLES`/`DATA_VIEWER_ROLES` constants can be migrated incrementally. `role === "ventas"` routing checks intentionally left as-is (routing decisions, not permission checks).

**Best practice:** A centralized `can(user, action, resource)` function that all UI components and API routes call. This:
- Provides a single place to modify permission logic
- Makes UI conditional rendering declarative (`{can('approve', 'reservation') && <ApproveButton />}`)
- Enables testing permission logic independently
- Makes the permission model auditable

~~**Recommendation:** Create a `permissions.ts` module with:~~
~~```typescript~~
~~function can(role: Role, action: Action, resource: Resource, scope?: Scope): boolean~~
~~```~~
~~Use this everywhere instead of scattered role checks.~~
**Implemented:** `can()` + `rolesFor()` in `src/lib/permissions.ts`.

### GAP-09: No Project-Scoped Admin Access
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** All admin users (master, torredecontrol) see all 4 projects in all views. There is no mechanism to restrict an admin user to specific projects.

**Best practice (Yardi model):** "User Property Security" — admins can be restricted to specific properties. Relevant for scenarios like:
- A regional manager who oversees only B5 and BEN
- A project-specific accountant
- A legal reviewer assigned to only one project's PCVs

**Identified in:** `docs/remaining-features.md` item #30: "Role-based access per project — currently all admin users see all projects."

**Recommendation:** Extend the `salesperson_project_assignments` model to cover admin roles, or create a generic `user_project_assignments` table.

---

## 4. Dashboard & Visualization Gaps

### GAP-10: No Role-Specific Dashboard Views — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-03-19)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~The main dashboard (`/`) is a monolith (`dashboard-client.tsx`, ~28KB) that shows the same content to all admin users.~~ **Resolved.** `/admin/operaciones` provides a dedicated operations dashboard for Pati (Torre de Control). The existing analytics dashboard at `/` remains unchanged. Simpler approach chosen: separate page, no routing change. Pati bookmarks `/admin/operaciones` as her landing page. Pati (torredecontrol) sees the same dashboard as the CFO (if the financiero role were active). There is no dashboard tailored to:
- CFO (financial KPIs, disbursement tracking, ISR summary)
- Sales Manager (team performance, pipeline health, coaching indicators)
- Executive (portfolio-level summary, trend arrows, project health scorecards)

**Best practice:** Each role has a landing page optimized for their primary concerns. The inverse density principle: executives see 5-7 large KPIs, managers see 8-12 with drill-down, operators see 10-15 with action queues.

**Impact:** Pati sees financial charts she doesn't act on. A future CFO would see operational details they don't need. Information overload reduces decision speed.

**Recommendation:** Create role-specific dashboard landing pages:
- `/` → route to role-appropriate dashboard
- `/dashboard/operaciones` → Torre de Control (work queues, pending approvals, data quality)
- `/dashboard/finanzas` → CFO (commissions, disbursements, ISR, cash flow)
- `/dashboard/gerencia` → Sales Manager (team KPIs, agent comparison)
- `/dashboard/ejecutivo` → C-Suite (portfolio summary, trend arrows)

### GAP-11: No Dedicated Operations Dashboard for Pati — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-03-19)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~Pati uses the analytics dashboard (same as everyone else) plus the admin reservations page. Her primary workflow — processing incoming reservations, cross-referencing data, catching errors, managing document flow — has no dedicated interface.~~ **Resolved.** `/admin/operaciones` — action-first operations command center with: 5 KPI cards (urgency-colored), 3-tab work queue (Pendientes sorted oldest-first, Tasas EV unconfirmed rates, Documentos missing DPI), activity feed (last 20 audit events). Selected reservations link through to `/admin/reservas` for full detail.

**Best practice:** The operator dashboard should be **action-first**: work queues with urgency indicators, exception lists (missing data, overdue items), and inline action buttons. The current analytics dashboard is **insight-first** — designed for understanding trends, not for processing a queue of 350+ clients.

**Impact:** Pati must context-switch between the analytics dashboard, the admin reservations page, and (still) Excel for payment tracking. Each switch costs cognitive load and increases error risk.

**Recommendation:** Build an operator command center for Pati:
- Pending approvals queue (sorted by age, with urgency color)
- Data quality alerts (missing DPI, incomplete profiles, unsigned PCVs)
- Daily transaction log
- Payment status overview (linked to remaining feature #14)
- Quick-action buttons for common operations

### GAP-12: Ventas Portal Lacks Progressive Disclosure
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** The ventas portal has 6 pages (panel, reservas, inventario, clientes, rendimiento, nueva-reserva). Each page loads its own data independently.

**Best practice:** Progressive disclosure — the panel (landing page) shows L0/L1 summary (KPI cards, sparklines), and each KPI links to the relevant detail page (L2: filterable table, L3: individual record).

**Impact:** Salespeople may not discover relevant information because the portal pages are isolated rather than interconnected. A salesperson seeing their commission KPI card should be able to tap it to see the commission breakdown, then tap a specific sale to see the commission detail.

**Recommendation:** Add click-through navigation from KPI cards on the panel to the corresponding detail pages.

### GAP-13: No Comparison Context on KPIs
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** KPI cards show current values (e.g., "Units Reserved: 5"). There is no comparison against:
- Target/quota
- Prior period (last month, same month last year)
- Team average

**Best practice:** Every KPI needs at least one comparison point. "5 units reserved" means nothing without context. "5 of 10 quota (50%)" or "5 (+2 vs last month)" tells a story.

**Recommendation:** Add comparison context to all KPI cards:
- Trend arrow (up/down vs prior period)
- Target bar (actual vs quota, where quota data exists)
- Color coding (green if on track, amber if behind, red if critical)

### GAP-14: Mobile Optimization for Ventas
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** The reservation form (`/reservar`) is designed for mobile (camera inputs, offline queue). But the ventas portal pages (panel, reservas, clientes, rendimiento) are standard responsive layouts without specific mobile optimization.

**Best practice:** Field sales teams need mobile-first dashboards:
- Card-based layouts instead of tables
- 44x44px minimum touch targets
- Reduced numerical precision ("Q45.2K" not "Q45,234.56")
- No hover-dependent interactions
- Single-question-per-screen pattern

**Recommendation:** Audit all ventas portal pages for mobile usability. Replace tables with card-based layouts on small screens. Ensure all interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes.

### GAP-15: No Chart Type Variety
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** The analytics dashboard uses D3 treemaps (excellent for inventory), commission bars, cash flow chart, and bullet charts. The ventas portal uses KPI cards with sparklines.

**Best practice:** Different questions demand different chart types:
- Trend over time → line chart
- Comparison → horizontal bar chart
- Composition → stacked bar (not pie with >5 slices)
- Pipeline funnel → funnel chart
- Process progression → Sankey diagram

**Missing chart types that would serve existing data:**
- Funnel chart for reservation pipeline (PENDING → CONFIRMED → PCV → SIGNED)
- Agent comparison bar chart for sales managers
- Aging histogram for payment delinquency

**Recommendation:** Add Recharts as a complement to D3. Use D3 for custom visualizations (treemaps), Recharts for standard charts (line, bar, funnel). This matches the Stripe pattern.

## 5. Authorization & Workflow Gaps

### GAP-16: No Maker-Checker on User Provisioning — ✅ RESOLVED (Option A, 2026-03-19)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~A single admin can create a new user account, assign them to projects, and send them credentials — all without any approval from a second person.~~ **Resolved (Option A: audit-only).** All user provisioning actions are logged to `audit_events` table via `logAudit()` — `salesperson.invited` events capture who invited whom, when, with full details (email, salesperson name, resend flag). `assignment.created`/`assignment.ended` events capture project assignment changes. The second admin can review the audit log at `/admin/audit` and revoke access if needed.

**Best practice:** User provisioning is a privileged operation (SOC 2 CC6.2). The maker-checker pattern requires a second admin to approve before the account is active.

~~**Recommendation:** At minimum, log all user provisioning actions with full audit trail. Ideally, require a second admin to approve before the invite link is sent.~~
**Implemented:** Option A (audit-only). Full maker-checker (Option B) deferred to Phase 6 — not practical for 2-admin team.

### GAP-17: No Approval Workflow for Desistimientos
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** Desistimiento is a single-step operation: admin clicks "desist" and the reservation is immediately cancelled, the unit returns to AVAILABLE. There is no:
- Required evidence (letter, email) before processing
- Second-person approval
- Waiting period
- Client notification

**Best practice (per remaining features #16):** Desistimiento workflow should require documentation (letter/email evidence) and potentially an approval chain.

**Recommendation:** Implement a two-step desistimiento: request (with required evidence attachment) → approval (by a different user than the requester).

### GAP-18: No Escalation Path for Rate Confirmation — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 074)
**Severity: Medium**

~~**Current state:** Only master can confirm ejecutivo rates. If the master user is unavailable, no one can confirm rates. Torre de Control can see rates but cannot confirm them.~~

**Resolved:** `financiero` role added to the ejecutivo-rate PATCH endpoint's `requireRole()` guard (`["master", "financiero"]`). CFO can now confirm rates as an escalation path when master is unavailable.

**Best practice:** Escalation paths should exist for all time-sensitive operations. If the primary approver is unavailable, a deputy or an escalation mechanism should exist.

~~**Recommendation:** Either:~~
~~- Allow torredecontrol to confirm rates (expand `requireRole` to include torredecontrol)~~
~~- Or implement a delegation mechanism (master can temporarily grant rate-confirmation rights)~~
**Implemented:** `financiero` added as rate confirmer — pragmatic escalation without delegation complexity.

### GAP-19: No Notification System
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** When a salesperson submits a reservation, the admin must manually check the admin reservations page to see it. When an admin confirms a reservation, the salesperson must manually check their portal. There are no push notifications, emails, or in-app alerts.

**Best practice:** Event-driven notifications for role-relevant state changes:
- Salesperson submits → notify admin (new pending review)
- Admin confirms → notify salesperson (reservation confirmed)
- Payment overdue → notify salesperson + admin
- Rate unconfirmed for >N days → notify master

**Recommendation:** Start with a simple notification system:
1. In-app notification badge (unread count on NavBar)
2. Email notifications for critical events (optional, configurable per user)

### GAP-20: No Temporal Permission Expiry
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** Once a role is assigned via `app_metadata`, it persists indefinitely. There is no mechanism for:
- Time-limited elevated access (e.g., temporary master access for a specific task)
- Automatic deactivation of accounts that haven't logged in for N days
- Seasonal access patterns (e.g., a salesperson who is only active during launch phases)

**Best practice:** Temporal access controls: accounts that have been inactive for 30+ days should be flagged for review, and elevated permissions should have optional expiry dates.

**Recommendation:** Build an admin view showing last login date per user. Flag accounts inactive >30 days. This is a SOC 2 requirement (CC6.3).

---

## 6. Compliance & Audit Gaps

### GAP-21: No Formal Access Control Matrix Document — ✅ RESOLVED (changelog 078, 2026-03-20)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~Permissions are defined implicitly across ~50 API routes and middleware logic. There is no single document that says "role X can do Y on resource Z."~~ **Resolved.** `docs/access-control-matrix.md` — auto-generated 7-role × 49-action matrix (22 resources, 119 grants). Generated from `src/lib/permissions.ts` PERMISSIONS object via `scripts/generate-access-matrix.ts`. Always in sync with code. Run `npx tsx scripts/generate-access-matrix.ts` to regenerate.

**Best practice (SOC 2 CC6.1, ISO 27001 A.5.15):** A formal, auditable access control matrix must exist. It should be reviewed quarterly and updated when roles or permissions change.

~~**Impact:** If Puerta Abierta ever undergoes a security audit or seeks compliance certification, the first question will be "show me your access control matrix." Currently, that would require reading every API route's source code.~~

~~**Recommendation:** The `docs/roles-current-state.md` (this analysis's Doc 1) is a first step. Convert the API authorization matrix into a structured format (spreadsheet or code-level data structure) that can be formally reviewed.~~
**Implemented:** `docs/access-control-matrix.md` (SOC 2 CC6.1 + ISO 27001 A.5.15 compliant). Regenerate on demand via `npx tsx scripts/generate-access-matrix.ts`.

### GAP-22: Incomplete Audit Trail — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-03-19)
**Severity: High**

**Current state:** ~~Audit logging exists for unit status changes and reservation reviews, but does NOT exist for system settings, user provisioning, commission rate changes, or export actions.~~ **Resolved.** Centralized `audit_events` table (migration 041) with `logAudit()` utility (`src/lib/audit.ts`). Fire-and-forget pattern — never crashes primary operation.

**11 event types instrumented across 10 admin routes:**
- `reservation.confirmed`, `reservation.rejected`, `reservation.desisted`
- `freeze.released`
- `rate.confirmed`
- `settings.updated`
- `salesperson.invited` (3 exit points: resend, link existing, new invite)
- `assignment.created`, `assignment.ended`
- `mgmt_role.created`, `mgmt_role.ended`

**Admin UI:**
- `/api/admin/audit-log` — GET with filtering (event_type, resource_type, actor_id, date range) + pagination
- `/admin/audit` — full audit log viewer (filterable table, expandable detail rows, pagination)
- Activity feed on `/admin/operaciones` (last 20 events)

**Still not logged (acceptable for current scale):** read access, login/logout (Supabase Auth internal), export/download actions.

### GAP-23: No Access Review Process
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** There is no mechanism to review whether existing users still need their current level of access. No reports show:
- Users by role
- Last login date per user
- Inactive accounts
- Over-privileged accounts (users with roles beyond their current job function)

**Best practice (SOC 2 CC6.3, ISO 27001):** Quarterly access reviews. An admin should be able to pull a report showing all users, their roles, last login, and project assignments, then certify that each user's access is still appropriate.

**Recommendation:** Build an access review dashboard in `/admin/asesores` showing:
- All users with roles and last login dates
- Inactive accounts (>30 days since last login)
- Role distribution chart
- One-click deactivation for revoked access

### GAP-24: No Data Classification or Minimization
**Severity: Medium**

**Current state:** All authenticated users (including ventas) can potentially access the same data through direct API calls (GAP-01). There is no data classification that marks certain data as "financial-sensitive" or "PII" and restricts access accordingly.

**Best practice (GDPR Art. 25, data minimization):** Data should be classified by sensitivity level, and each role should only see the minimum data necessary for their function:
- **Public:** Unit availability, project info
- **Internal:** Reservation details, client names
- **Confidential:** DPI numbers, financial data, commission amounts
- **Restricted:** System settings, user credentials, audit logs

**Recommendation:** Classify all data fields by sensitivity level. Align API field masking and RLS policies to enforce data minimization per role.

## 7. Gap Summary Matrix

| # | Gap | Category | Severity | Effort | Current State | Best Practice |
|---|-----|----------|----------|--------|---------------|---------------|

## 8. Prioritized Remediation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Security Hardening — ✅ COMPLETED (2026-03-19, changelogs 074 + 075)

| Priority | Gap | Action | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| P0 | GAP-02 | `requireAuth()` + 20 req/hr rate limiting on OCR endpoints | ✅ Done |
| P0 | GAP-04 | Explicit 5-category middleware routing + role-filtered NavBar | ✅ Done |
| P0 | GAP-01 | `requireRole()` on 30 API routes (4 groups) | ✅ Done |
| P1 | GAP-05 | Ownership-scoped RLS policies on 4 tables + `jwt_role()` helper | ✅ Done |

**All Phase 1 security gaps resolved before salesperson go-live.**

### Phase 2: Architecture Foundation (Before activating new roles)

| Priority | Gap | Action | Effort |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| ✅ | GAP-06 | Role hierarchy (`ROLE_LEVEL`, `ADMIN_ROLES`, `DATA_VIEWER_ROLES`, `hasMinimumRole()`) | ✅ Done (changelog 074) |
| ✅ | GAP-08 | Create `can(role, action, resource)` permission utility | ✅ Done (changelog 078) |
| ✅ | GAP-07 | Define formal access control matrix in code | ✅ Done (changelog 078) |
| ✅ | GAP-03 | ~~Implement role-aware field masking on analytics API routes~~ | ✅ Done (changelog 079) |

**Rationale:** GAP-06/07/08 resolved. GAP-21 (access control document) also resolved. ~~Remaining: GAP-03 (field masking) must be in place before activating gerencia, financiero, contabilidad, or inventario roles.~~ GAP-03 resolved 2026-03-20. **All pre-activation work is complete. gerencia/financiero/contabilidad roles are now safe to activate for real users.**

### Phase 3: Pati's Workflow Optimization (Highest ROI for mission) — ✅ GAP-10/11 COMPLETED

| Priority | Gap | Action | Effort | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| P1 | GAP-11 | Build operations command center for Torre de Control | 16-24 hours | ✅ `/admin/operaciones` |
| P2 | GAP-10 | Create role-specific dashboard routing | 8-16 hours | ✅ Separate page approach |
| P2 | GAP-13 | Add comparison context to KPI cards | 4-8 hours | Pending |

**Rationale:** The mission is to obliterate Pati's Excel dependency. A dedicated operations dashboard — not a shared analytics view — is the interface that replaces her Excel workflow.

### Phase 4: Ventas Portal Enhancement

| Priority | Gap | Action | Effort |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| P2 | GAP-12 | Add click-through navigation from panel KPIs to detail pages | 2-4 hours |
| P2 | GAP-14 | Mobile-first audit of ventas portal pages | 4-8 hours |
| P3 | GAP-19 | Implement in-app notification system | 16-24 hours |

### Phase 5: Compliance & Audit (Before external audit or scale) — ✅ GAP-22 COMPLETED

| Priority | Gap | Action | Effort | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| P2 | GAP-22 | Create `audit_events` table + logging for all admin actions | 8-16 hours | ✅ Migration 041 + logAudit() |
| ✅ | GAP-21 | Formalize access control matrix as auditable document | 2-4 hours | ✅ Done (changelog 078) |
| P3 | GAP-23 | Build access review dashboard (users, roles, last login) | 4-8 hours | Pending |
| P3 | GAP-24 | Classify data by sensitivity, align with access controls | 4-8 hours | Pending |

### Phase 6: Advanced Capabilities (When scale demands it)

| Priority | Gap | Action | Effort |
|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| P3 | GAP-09 | Project-scoped admin access (user_project_assignments) | 16-24 hours |
| P3 | GAP-15 | Add funnel, comparison, aging chart types via Recharts | 8-16 hours |
| ✅ | GAP-16 | ~~Maker-checker on user provisioning~~ Audit-only (Option A) | ✅ Done |
| P3 | GAP-17 | Two-step desistimiento workflow | 8-16 hours |
| ✅ | GAP-18 | ~~Rate confirmation escalation/delegation~~ financiero added | ✅ Done (changelog 074) |
| P3 | GAP-20 | Temporal permission expiry and inactivity flags | 4-8 hours |

## Summary

The Orion role system is **secure for its current 3-role production deployment** ~~but has **significant gaps when measured against the enterprise standards the project aspires to**~~. **Phase 1 (security hardening) is complete** — all critical and high-severity security gaps have been resolved (changelogs 074 + 075). The system now has 4-layer defense-in-depth: explicit middleware role routing, role-guarded API routes, ownership-scoped RLS policies, and role-filtered NavBar links.

~~The most urgent work is in Phase 1 (security hardening) and Phase 2 (architecture foundation) — both should be completed before the 32-salesperson go-live.~~

~~The remaining gaps are structural (GAP-07/08 permission matrix), field masking (GAP-03), and advanced items (GAP-09 project scoping, GAP-17 desist workflow, GAP-19 notifications).~~ **Update (2026-03-20):** Phase 2 resolved GAP-07/08/21 + DISC-03 (changelog 078). ~~The remaining gaps are field masking (GAP-03), and advanced items (GAP-09 project scoping, GAP-17 desist workflow, GAP-19 notifications).~~ **Update (2026-03-20 evening):** Phase 4 resolved GAP-03 (changelog 079). The remaining gaps are advanced items only (GAP-09 project scoping, GAP-17 desist workflow, GAP-19 notifications, etc.) — all deferred to Phase 6. See `docs/plan-fix-high-severity-gaps.md` for the detailed remediation plan, `docs/plan-phase3-audit-phase5-dashboard.md` for the completed audit + operations work, `docs/plan-phase2-permission-architecture.md` for the completed permission architecture, and `docs/plan-phase4-field-masking.md` for the completed field masking.

Total estimated effort for remaining phases: **~32 hours** (Phase 6 only). Down from ~56 hours after Phase 4 completion.

## Addendum: Post-Auth Redirect Fixes (2026-03-20)

### Context

Production testing with two ventas users revealed 5 compounding failures in the auth redirect layer — not covered by GAP-01 through GAP-24 (which focus on the role system). These were *auth flow* failures: the login page, login form, set-password page, auth/confirm route, and root page all had blind `redirect("/")` or `router.replace("/")` calls that ignored the user's role, sending ventas users to the admin dashboard.

### Issues Found and Fixed

| # | Issue | Impact | Fix |
|---|-------|--------|-----|
| AUTH-01 | `login/page.tsx` — `redirect("/")` ignores role | Ventas on `/login` → admin dashboard | Role-aware redirect |
| AUTH-02 | `login-form.tsx` + `set-password/page.tsx` — `router.replace("/")` race | Admin dashboard flashes before middleware redirect | `window.location.href` (hard navigation) |
| AUTH-03 | `auth/confirm` always forces password re-set | Returning users forced to re-set password | Check `password_set` before routing |
| AUTH-04 | `page.tsx` has no server-side auth guard | Any user reaching `/` sees admin dashboard | Async Server Component with full guard |
| AUTH-05 | Pre-March-17 users missing `password_set` | Infinite set-password redirect loop | SQL backfill |

### Why Not in GAP Framework

These issues were not role system gaps but *navigation* failures. The role system correctly identified users and enforced boundaries at middleware/API/RLS layers. The problem was in the login → redirect → landing chain, where three code paths (login page Server Component, login-form client navigation, set-password client navigation) bypassed middleware's role-aware routing entirely.

Full investigation: `docs/plan-auth-deep-investigation.md`

### Updated Defense-in-Depth Model

The system now has **6 layers** of defense (previously 5):

```
Layer 1: Middleware         — Role-based page routing (5 categories)
Layer 2: Page auth guards   — Server-side role check on root page (NEW)
Layer 3: API route guards   — requireRole() on 30+ routes, 15 using rolesFor()
Layer 4: Field masking      — Post-query response shaping per role (4 analytics routes) (NEW — Phase 4)
Layer 5: RLS policies       — Ownership-scoped SELECT on 4 tables + jwt_role()
Layer 6: Client UI filtering — NavBar role-filtered links + role-aware tab visibility
```

Layer 4 is new (2026-03-20) — `src/lib/field-masking.ts` applies per-resource masking after Supabase queries and before `jsonOk()`. gerencia sees aggregates only, contabilidad sees anonymized names, financiero/master/torredecontrol see full data.

Layer 2 is new — `src/app/page.tsx` now validates the user's role server-side before rendering, preventing the admin dashboard from being visible to unauthorized users even if middleware fails to redirect.
